# Update Summary - Audio Reactivity & Lighting System

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Waveform Instancing Now Works! 🎵
**Problem:** The waveform instancer created its own audio player but never played it, so the visualizer had no data.

**Solution:**
- Created a muted `Tone.Player` connected to the waveform analyzer
- Added `isPlaying` atom subscription to sync with main playback
- When main audio plays, the analyzer player also plays (muted)
- The `useFrame` hook now receives real-time waveform data
- Instances animate based on audio amplitude

**Result:** Audio-reactive instancing now works perfectly! Each instance scales/moves based on audio frequency data.

### 2. Complete Lighting System Added 💡

#### New Light Types:
1. **Ambient Light** - Global illumination
   - Color, Intensity

2. **Directional Light** - Sun-like parallel rays
   - Color, Intensity, Cast Shadow
   - Position (direction)

3. **Point Light** - Omnidirectional light source
   - Color, Intensity, Distance, Decay
   - Cast Shadow
   - Position

4. **Spot Light** - Focused cone of light
   - Color, Intensity, Distance, Decay
   - Angle, Penumbra (softness)
   - Target position (where it points)
   - Cast Shadow
   - Position

5. **Environment Light** - HDR environment map
   - Uses `@react-three/drei` Environment component
   - Preset: "sunset"

#### Components Created:
- `src/features/scene/types.ts` - Added `LightObject` and `LightType`
- `src/features/scene/factories/light-factory.ts` - Factory function for all light types
- `src/features/canvas/components/light-renderer.tsx` - Renders lights in viewport
- `src/features/inspector/components/light-section.tsx` - Light properties UI
- `src/features/inspector/components/light-inspector.tsx` - Full light inspector

#### Inspector Features:
- Color picker with keyframe support
- Intensity drag input with keyframe support
- Type-specific properties (distance, angle, etc.)
- Shadow casting toggle
- Spot light target position (XYZ)
- All properties can be keyframed!

#### Compose Bar Integration:
Added 4 light buttons in a new section:
- 🔦 **Ambient** - Quick global lighting
- ☀️ **Directional** - Sunlight
- ⚡ **Point** - Lightbulb
- 🔺 **Spot** - Stage spotlight

#### Visual Feedback:
When selected, lights show:
- **Point/Directional:** Yellow wireframe sphere at position
- **Spot:** Yellow wireframe cone + purple wireframe sphere at target
- Helps visualize light placement in 3D space

## 🎬 How It All Works Now

### Audio-Reactive Workflow:
1. Upload audio → Duration automatically set
2. Add waveform instancer → Select target primitive
3. Press Play → Main audio plays + analyzer syncs
4. Instances react to audio in real-time! 🎶

### Lighting Workflow:
1. Click light button in compose bar → Light added to scene
2. Select light → Inspector shows light properties
3. Adjust color, intensity, position, etc.
4. Add keyframes to animate lights! 
5. Lights cast shadows (if enabled) on objects

### Example Scenes:
- **Music Visualizer:** Waveform instancer + Point lights animating with music
- **Dramatic Scene:** Directional light with shadows + Ambient fill
- **Club Scene:** Multiple spot lights with animated colors
- **Product Shot:** Environment light + Key/Fill spots
