Task: Add a new object type to the editor: Waveform Lines
User Interactions: 
 - Users can change the appearance of the lines on the inspector panel, settings:
  * Line amount
  * Line gaps (vertical)
  * line start gap (clump all together on the start = 0, same as line gaps = 1)
  * line end gap (clump..)
  * Smoothing (how curved it is instead of choppy lines)
  * thickness (per line)
  * material (it will be a linematerial i know but it would be nice if users can set color, glow, glowcolor stuff like that)
  * layout (linear, radial)
  * dynamic height (max height for amp)
  * audio threshold (0 - 1)
  * audio gain (def 1.0, 0 - 10)
  * freq start (0 - 1)
  * freq end (0 - 1)
  * emissive boost (0 - 10) (how much glow intensifies to the beat)
  * pivot point (top, center, bottom) (basically the baseline from where to grow up/down)
  * offset (if you think of the line wave as left beginning right end, the offset is like a modulo ring, pushing the right parts to the start and the start closer to the center) (0 - 1)
 - As there can be smoothing, it probably makes sense to use beziercurves
 - Users can set the transform of the line object (the group)
 - The waveform lines react to the audio like the waveform instancer

State Management: 
 - same as waveform instancer

Notes:
 - this is NOT the waveform instancer, so write dedicated files for this do not mix them up (even if the audio extraction logic is veery similar)
 - make it as efficient as the waveform instancer, even more so if possible, there will be dozens of waveform line instances in a scene

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
