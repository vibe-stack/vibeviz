Task: [Brief Summary of what needs to be done]
Functional Requirements: [A list of bullet points describing the feature in detail]
User Interactions: [How users interact with this, usually bullet points]
Data Requirements: [What data it needs and where it comes from]

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
