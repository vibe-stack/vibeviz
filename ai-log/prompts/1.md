Task: Add proper customizations to the visualization engine.

User Interactions:
 - Currently it just simply renders bars. Add many more visualization modes:
 - particle systems (that react to the audio), with settings
 - Animated Shaders:
  * It shows a list of prebuilt animated shaders that are reacting to the audio, some may have settings
  * Users can only select one (or none) shader to the viewport
  * It uses TSL (Three Shading Language) to create visualizations
  * Just add one or two basic examples that look like winamp shaders to that list
  * Each Shader is essentially a react component that renders itself, and receives the audio data and state
  * 
Data Requirements: [What data it needs and where it comes from]
State Management: [How state should be handled, should it be held locally? global? persistent? cached?]
Notes: [any additional information in an unstructured way that the AI should know about]

Sidequest:
 - There is a bug where the visualization and timeline only sync and actually progress if i manually seek after pressing play. Initially pressing play keeps both frozen (but i still hear audio)


Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
