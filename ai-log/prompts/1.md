Task: Add proper customizations to the visualization engine.

User Interactions:
 - Currently it just simply renders bars. Add many more visualization modes:
 - particle systems (that react to the audio), with settings
 - Animated Shaders:
  * It shows a list of prebuilt animated shaders that are reacting to the audio, some may have settings
  * Users can only select one (or none) shader to the viewport
  * It uses TSL (Three Shading Language) to create visualizations
  * Just add one or two basic examples that look like winamp shaders to that list
  * Each Shader is essentially a react component that renders itself, and receives the audio data and state

State Mangement: I have installed valtio. Use valtio for global state management instead of scattered useStates.
- However once playback starts, have a global react context that passes the current time in a ref, for performance reasons.
- Most components are r3f based and will use useFrame, so reading from a ref is more efficient instead of going through state transitions in react

Notes:
 - Use Threejs Webgpu exclusively. I have configured r3f to use the webgpurenderer already. All regular THREE imports go through "three/webgpu"

Sidequest:
 - There is a bug where the visualization and timeline only sync and actually progress if i manually seek after pressing play. Initially pressing play keeps both frozen (but i still hear audio)

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
