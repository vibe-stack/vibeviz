Task: Build a Music Visualizer App based on react three fiber.

User Interactions:
 - Users can upload mp3 files (in memory, from filesystem)
 - It renders the waveform as visuals, with bars outside a circle
  - allow users to set the radius as well as max bar height
 - Users can seek through the rendering/audio on the bottom in a timeline
 - The timeline shows the waveform of the audio clip too
 - add a floating panel overlay on the right to set the settings of the visualization

State:
 - just make sure audio and visuals are in sync at all times, idgaf how you do it

Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- one react component per file, preferably write small composable react components over large monolithic ones
- Use a dark, calm, minimalistic and rounded UI. Do not use tailwind gray, instead zinc, with slight opacity and bg blur
