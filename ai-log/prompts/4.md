Task: Create a new category of visualizations: Shapes

Notes:
 - Users can choose from a variety of shapes, they will be placed at 0,0,0
 - They can set the scale, base rotation
 - Add different (stackable) animations they can choose from:
  - Rotate:
   * Allow users to set a rotation animation, they set the direction it rotates
   * There are different rotation modes syncing with the music: Slow down on beat, Speed up on beat, Reverse on beat, Temporary Reverse on beat (mirror-like, briefly reverses and continues in the direction again)
  - Scale:
   * Allow users to set a scale animation, they set the min and max scales
   * There are different scaling modes syncing with the music: Slow down on beat, Speed up on beat, reverse on beat, temporary reverse on beat (mirror like). Additionally for scale there is a heartbeat animation
 - They can set material settings for the shapes, from color, metalness, roughness, emissive, etc.

Shapes:
 - Cube

 - Heart (a low poly heart)
 - Star
