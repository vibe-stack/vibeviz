Task: Rework the particle system

Notes: Currently the particle system is very simplistic. The idea here is to add music audio files and a highly configurable particle system animation.
Add more animation capabilities, different settings so users can create a variety of different particle based visualizations for music.
The current one just floats and vibrates with the audio. There are plenty of different visualizations one could do with particles, implement them.
First think about what you would change and report back. I will tell you which ones to go for.


Guidelines:
- Colocate files by their features
- Write small modular files, avoid any big files
- Prefer to write dedicated, colocated hooks files over inline hooks in react components
- Use a dark, calming, minimalistic and rounded UI.
